Swicket! 

Swicket is an app that allows you to switch tickets with another ticket-holder at an event. If you have to leave early post a ticket on Swicket so that you can share your awesome seat. Only want to see the opener at a concert? Get a first row seat and then use Swicket to sell your ticket to someone in the back.

Features to implement:

1. Post a ticket
2. Claim a ticket
3. Logins
4. Location/time awareness to automatically check you in at an event (stubhub API)
5. Messaging system
